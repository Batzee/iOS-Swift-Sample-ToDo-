iOS-Swift-Sample-ToDo-
======================

A sample ToDo app developed using Swift for iPhone

This is a sample ToDo app developed using SWIFT for iOS, based on the video tutorial found here
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEYHd91YzNI&src_vid=sxDSc2Z2W4g&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_4227670465"

Unfortuanately the video is a bit out dated that it has many bugs when trying it out in the Xcode 6, so i have fixed them and committed the working version
